	          <b></b><p> Hey babe, I know you’re having fun right now sa days and I just want you to know that I love you. I know we’ve been through a lot this past few months but do know that I’m willing to do everything and anything for you. I know that a part of you hates me and maybe a part of you wants to part ways with me but no matter what you decide on or what you really want, do know that nothing will change and you’re still the person I want to be with no matter what. Everyone around you appreciates you and loves you. Maybe different persons have different ways to express their love for you but do know that they love you so much. Your parents love you despite the actions they show you, ALWAYS remember that. With your work, things already changed and now I realized that work is and always will be part of you. I already accepted that I must understand you and trust you with that. 

	It’s been 354 days since the day you said yes to me, it may not be that special, but I wouldn’t forget the date you said yes. It’s been 354 days and counting that my life has changed for the better, its been 354 days since I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you and days I couldn’t count that I want to make you happy. You’ve made my life easier and better, you made me realize that I want to do so much in this world and you opened my heart to be a kind person that I wasn’t before. 

	To be honest, I really had a problem writing this letter because I ran out of words to tell you because almost every time we talk I try to say the best things and I want you to know that this letter may not be the same, but I just want you to know that my actions speaks louder than the words I say. I will always and forever be here to show you and make you feel your worth, I will always be the one of your biggest fans and would continually show my support to you despite the circumstances. I love you with all my heart, with all my soul and with everything I have and can give. Till the day I die, you have, and you always will have a special place in my heart my princess, queen and the love of my life.
